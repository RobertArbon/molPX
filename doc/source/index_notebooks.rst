   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Example Notebook
==================
You can find this notebook in the ``projX/notebooks/`` directory and execute it yourself.

Unfortunately for this html documentation, ``nglview``'s output, i.e. the pictures
of molecular structures, `cannot be <https://github.com/arose/nglview/issues/37#issuecomment-266757667>`_
stored currently in the notebook file. In short: this html-notebook is lacking the most visually appealing part
of ``projX``. You can check the :doc:`Youtube </about>` video or the :doc:`gif animation </index>`
to see ``projX`` in action.
